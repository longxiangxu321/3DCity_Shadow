# 3DCMSolarIrradiance
This repository contains the implementation of a Solar Irradiance simulation tool for 3D City Models based on the 3DCityDB.

This is for calculate and store results in .bin file. No point cloud stored.



# Shadow Calculation

## Environment

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
conda create --name shadow python=3.9
```

Activate:

```bash
conda activate shadow
```

Install package:

```bash
pip install pvlib numpy pytz pandas
```



## Config.json

```json
{
    "study_area": {
        "timezone": "Europe/Amsterdam",
        "lat": 52.285126,
        "long": 6.435649,
        "start_time": "2013-12-31 00:00:00",
        "end_time": "2014-01-01 23:59:59",
        "frequency": "H",
        "data_root": "./data/rh"
    },
    "shadow_calc": {
        "save_result_pc": false,
        "target_surfaces": [
            "WallSurface",
            "RoofSurface"
        ]
    },
    "num_treads":4
}
```

For your own project: following configuration needs to be set accordingly:

- timezone
- lat
- long
- start_time
- end_time
- frequency
  - Default is 1 hour. Other available frequency: [Time series / date functionality â€” pandas 2.2.0 documentation (pydata.org)](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/timeseries.html#timeseries-offset-aliases)
- save_result_pc
  - Set to ***true*** if you wish to save the point grid result for every calculation moment. The points that are not shadowed will be saved for each moment. Not recommended if calculation moments are large.
- target_surfaces
  - The surface for which you wish to calculate if they are shadowed. 
  - Recommended for using "WallSurface" and "RoofSurface". Others available. Please refer OGC CityGML standards.
- num_threads
  - According to your device


## Expected folder structure

```
config.json
data
	- rh
		- citymodel
			- neighbouring_tiles
			- target_tiles
				- Rijssen-Holten.city.json
```



## Build

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```



In case of permission error on WSL, add following to `/etc/wsl.conf`

```
[automount]
enabled = true
options = "metadata"
```



## Run

go to project folder:

```
cd ..
python solar_pos.py
```



```
cd build
./shadow_calculation
```





# Solar Irradiance Calculation

go to the project root folder:

```
python calculate_irradiance.py
```





# Resulting folder structure

```
config.json
data
	- rh
		- citymodel
			- neighbouring_tiles
			- target_tiles
				- Rijssen-Holten.city.json
		- output_{datetime}
			- intermediate
				- sun_pos.csv
				- grid.xyz
			- shadow_result
				- result_pcs
					- shadow_result_grid.xyz
				- gmlids.csv
				- results.bin
			- hourly_irradiance.npz
			- config.json
